I am currently a business analytics master’s student at UCSD Rady School of Management. In 2019, I co-founded Chlorinie, a boutique manufacturer and marketer of HCIO-based disinfectants, where I served as the Chief Marketing Officer. My experience focused on product development and turning user data analytics into actionable business decisions. Prior to Chlorinie, I attained her bachelor’s degree in Arts at Smith College and has worked as lead marketing business analyst and product analyst at two emerging start-ups in Hangzhou, China. I am currently looking for a 2020 new grad data analyst position.
